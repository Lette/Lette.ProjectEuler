
Experimental: NuGet
	DONE Create NuGet package for PEMath
	DONE Create NuGet package for PECore
	DONE Setup nuget feed
		DONE Local? GitHub? NuGet? MyGet?
			(Feed on https://www.myget.org/F/lette/)
	SKIP Automate the nuget push to myget
	DONE Use NuGet/MyGet to reference PEMath and PECore
	DONE Create separate solution files for the individual parts
		DONE PECore
		DONE PEMath
		DONE ConsoleRunner
		DONE WpfRunner
		DONE Solutions
		DONE Solutions.Demo
		DONE Put Solutions in a dropbox folder with symlink

DONE Create NuGet package for Solutions.Demo (w/o tests)

DONE ConsoleRunner should include a version of the solutions.demo assembly

DONE WpfRunner should include a version of the solutions.demo assembly

DONE How can we add the dependency to System.Numerics to the Nuget-package?
	(With the help of the <frameworkAssembly> tag.)

Move EulerDataAttribute to Core.XUnit.
	Remove from Solutions.Tests
	Remove from Solutions.Demo.Tests
	
Fix code issue in WpfRunner

Publish PE code to GitHub
	Separate repos?
		+ Less code, more configurability
		- Can't reuse common code (which is prolly only CommonAssemblyInfo)
		Can still have a common project site via a "parent" GitHub repo...
	Publish example solutions (first 10?) only??
		.gitignore? (No. Cannot have solution- or repo-specific .gitignores)
		Maybe use submodule? (Prolle not.)
	SKIP Publish full Solutions to separate repo
		Private repo? 50 spänn/mo
	SKIP Publish solutions as binary only?
	Extract PE Solutions to a truly separate project?

DONE Create unit tests with xUnit.net that executes the solutions directly

Solver/SuiteBuilder should be able to create suites from multiple assemblies

Solver/SuiteBuilder should be able to create suites from executing assembly

Solver/SuiteBuilder - better naming? "suite" ???

Solver/SuiteBuilder should require much less code to set up in the simple case.
	What does it take to "Get Started"? Think developer experience.
	Create a demo project with simplest possible code required to use the framework.

A solutions assembly should be allowed to have an initializer - a.k.a. 2L.Factors(); to generate the prime sieve...

Make sure that the solution timer returns actual cpu time

Make a better logo for Lette.ProjectEuler
	Prolly ain't allowed to use PE favicon...

Document the nuget push to myget in each projects README

NuGet: Enable package restore where appropriate

Rewrite GUI
	Remove colors
	Use different layout for display of solutions (what panel?)
	Add some "air" (elegance?)

Write tests for the Math lib.

Experimental: PEMath in F#?

Experimental: GUI: Load Problems/Solutions dynamically


DONE Remove commands from code-behind and put them in view model
	DONE Quit
	DONE Start
	DONE Stop
DONE Clean up all in code-behind and move to view model and controller
	DONE Empty the code behind
	DONE Restructure the Controller/Solver
	DONE Solver shouldn't know about Repo
DONE Experimental: Rewrite parallel work to use async/await
DONE Add DI to the mix!
DONE Display solutions sorted on problem number always (ie. even when running in parallel)
	(Did it in XAML using "CollectionViewSource"!)
DONE Move PEMath to separate assembly
DONE Wrong errors must be marked as such!!!
DONE Fix namespaces in Wpf-app (to "Lette.*")
DONE Add description to GUI and make it link to pe.org.
DONE Create wrapper for static class Process
DONE Make SolveAll truly async
DONE Move cancellation to the Solver class
DONE Implement a "Cancelable" variant of IProblem.Solve
DONE Clean up the code paths for cancellable problems in Solver.
DONE Removed separate Cancellable problem type
SKIP Experimental: Create default implementation of ICancellableProblem
DONE Experimental: Create command line runner
	DONE Move Solver to separate assembly
	DONE Create console app
	DONE Create command line runner ("Lette.ProjectEuler.Runner Lette.ProjectEuler.Solutions")
SKIP Separate "Problems" (mostly metadata) from "Solutions"
DONE Move Problems/Solutions to separate assembly
DONE Add a way for the view to indicate whether solve should be linear or parallel
DONE Move "IsCorrect", "IsWrong" and "IsInconclusive" back into Solution class
DONE Add "IsCanceled" to the Solution class
DONE Handle problems that throw
	DONE Solution should have a "Exception"-property
	DONE ProposedAnswer should be a Nullable<long>
	DONE A throwing solution should be considered "Faulted"
DONE Make sure that all "IsXxx" of Solution are mutually inconclusive
DONE Set up a CommonAssemblyInfo
DONE No project should have a dependency on the Solutions project
DONE Runner should work with assembly file name
DONE ConsoleRunner should work with command line arguments
	DONE Parse arguments
	DONE Implement arguments
DONE ConsoleRunner needs better exception handling
DONE WPF: Move path to solutions assembly to app.config
DONE WPF: Rename project to Lette.ProjectEuler.WpfRunner
DONE Clean up problem 70
SKIP Clean up problem 84
